\section{Strings}

Ada has several string types which accommodate most uses for strings. This chapter will look at
a couple of them, as well as noting some of the differences in behavior and usage when compared
to C/C++/Java strings.

The default string type is the fixed-length |String| defined in the Reference Manual as:

\begin{lstlisting}
type String is array(Positive range <>) of Character;
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent This is an unconstrained array type, but the use of Positive as the index type means
that the smallest index available is 1. Any time a string is created, its index range will need
to be provided, either explicitly or implicitly.

\begin{lstlisting}
Buffer   : String(1 .. 32);   -- A buffer of 32 characters
Message  : String := "ABCDE"; -- Constrained by initializer to (1 .. 5)
Message2 : String := Message & Message; -- Constrained by initializer to (1 .. 10)
\end{lstlisting}

One important distinction between Ada's |String| type and strings found in other languages is
that once a string has been declared to be a particular size, it cannot be resized. Also, you
don't need to include an extra character position to hold a NULL character, as Ada doesn't use
them to end strings. In fact, the NULL character is a valid character in the middle of an Ada
string.

It is common to want to work with a portion of a string. Fortunately this can easily be done
using array slices. Since the |String| type is just an array of characters, techniques that
apply to any array (e.g., slicing, concatenation) also work for strings.

\begin{lstlisting}
-- Using the Message variable declared earlier.
Put_Line(Message);                           -- Prints "ABCDE"
Put_Line(Message(2 .. 4));                   -- Prints "BCD"
Put_Line(Message(1 .. 2) & Message(4 .. 5)); -- Prints "ABDE"
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Note the use of the |&| operator, which is used to concatenate arrays in Ada and
proves convenient for joining strings.

Another important detail is that, while Ada's Strings often start with 1, you should never
assume they start with 1 unless you can see their declaration. This is actually true for any
array type in Ada, as the indices are allowed to start at any value. The program in
Listing~\ref{lst:string-program} is an example of a procedure that assumes its argument starts
at 1 along with a better written version that does not make that assumption.

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
\begin{lstlisting}[
    frame=single,
    xleftmargin=0in,
    caption={String Reversing Program},
    label=lst:string-program]
with Ada.Text_Io; use Ada.Text_Io;
procedure String_Reverse is

   -- A naive implementation that assumes string indices start at 1.
   procedure Naive_Reverse_Print(S : String) is
   begin
      for I in reverse 1 .. S'Length loop
         Put(S(I));
      end loop;
   end Naive_Reverse_Print;

   -- A better implementation that makes no assumptions about the string.
   procedure Reverse_Print(S : String) is
   begin
      for I in reverse S'Range loop
         Put(S(I));
      end loop;
   end Reverse_Print;

   Message : String := "ABCDE";
begin
   Naive_Reverse_Print(Message);   -- Prints EDCBA
   New_Line;
   --Naive_Reverse_Print(Message(3 .. 5)); -- Constraint error if uncommented
   New_Line;
   Reverse_Print(Message);         -- Prints EDCBA
   New_Line;
   Reverse_Print(Message(3 .. 5)); -- Prints EDC
   New_Line;
end String_Reverse;   
\end{lstlisting}    
\end{figure}


Because Ada's String type is simply an array of Characters, all the useful attributes for using
arrays are available:

\emph{MyString'First} gives the First valid index.

\emph{MyString'Last} gives Last valid index.

\emph{MyString'Range} is equivalent to |(MyString'First .. MyString'Last)| and is useful for
loops that index the entire array.

\emph{MyString'Length} gives the length of the string. Do not use the length attribute to
calculate an index. Always use |'First| or |'Last| instead.
\\\\ % Force linebreak.
There are also various helper procedures and functions available in the package
|Ada.Strings.Fixed|, such as:

\emph{Move} copies one string into another, including padding and truncating if they are
different sizes.

\emph{Index} returns the index of a substring within a string or 0 if not found.

\emph{Insert, Delete, Replace\_Slice} modifies a string.

\emph{Trim} removes extra spaces from a string.
\\\\ % Force linebreak
See the Ada Reference Manual (A.4.3) for the complete list as well as a description of what each
one does. Many are available as either a function (returning the modified string) or a procedure
(modifying the string you give it). Ada will look at how you call it to determine the correct
one to use.

In common usage, Ada's fixed length strings are often used to hold smaller strings. Because the
NULL character is not considered special and does not end the string, a different method for
keeping track of the end of a string is needed. The most common method is simply using a
separate variable to keep track of the last valid index; Ada's built-in procedures use this
method.

If we want to read a string from the user, assuming we already have declared:

\begin{lstlisting}
Buffer : String(1 .. 32);
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent We will also need to declare:

\begin{lstlisting}
Buffer_Last : Natural;
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Note that the string indices are declared as type |Positive| (1 .. Integer'Max), but
|Buffer_Last| is declared as type |Natural| (0 .. Integer'Max). This allows the use of the value
0 to indicate that there is no valid index containing the last character (ie the string is
``empty'' - none of the 32 characters in it have valid data).

The program can now use the |Get_Line| procedure (available in the |Ada.Text_IO| package) like
so:

\begin{lstlisting}
Get_Line(Buffer, Buffer_Last);
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent This will read characters from the standard input device until either the buffer is
full (in which case |Buffer_Last| will be set to 32) or the ENTER key is pressed (in which case
|Buffer_Last| will be set to the index of the last valid character input or to 0 if no
characters were input before ENTER was pressed).

If the program needs to print out the data we read in earlier, the code might look like:

\begin{lstlisting}
Put_Line(Buffer(1 .. Buffer_Last));
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Here it is OK to assume the string |Buffer| starts at 1 because we can see where it is
declared. If |Buffer_Last| is a 0, because nothing was entered before the ENTER was pressed, the
resulting code will be:

\begin{lstlisting}
Put_Line(Buffer(1 .. 0));
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent This results in an empty string (a valid string with no characters in it) that
|Put_Line| happily prints to the screen by printing no characters and moving to the next
line. Ada will always give you an empty array when the range for a slice has a starting point
higher than the ending point, and this works for strings as well.

Ada's fixed strings are fast and efficient, but can be inconvenient to use for data of unknown
size. They also are not easy to use for appending new data on to the end of an existing string
variable.  For these applications, the |Unbounded_String| type may be a better choice. This
string type is similar to C++ and Java strings, but is a little more difficult to use because it
is not the default string type.

To use these strings, you will need to |with| the package |Ada.Strings.Unbounded| in your
program. You can then declare variables of type |Ada.Strings.Unbounded.Unbounded_String|.
Because that's quite a mouthful, many programs will rename the |Ada.Strings.Unbounded| package
or add a |use| declaration at the top for simple programs. You may also want the package
|Ada.Text_IO.Unbounded_IO| if you want to be able to |Get| and |Put| this type of string.
Alternatively, you can use the |To_String| function to convert it to a |String| and then use
|Ada.Text_IO| for |Get| and |Put|.

A simple program to read a (possibly large) line of text and print it back out is shown in
Listing~\ref{lst:unbounded-string-program}.

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
    \begin{lstlisting}[
    frame=single,
    xleftmargin=0in,
    caption={Unbounded String Program},
    label=lst:unbounded-string-program]
with Ada.Strings.Unbounded; use Ada.Strings.Unbounded;
with Ada.Text_IO;
with Ada.Text_IO.Unbounded_IO;

procedure Unbounded_Example is
   package UIO renames Ada.Text_IO.Unbounded_IO;

   MyString : Unbounded_String;
begin
   -- Read a long line from the user.
   Ada.Text_IO.Put("Enter a long line: ");
   UIO.Get_Line(MyString);

   -- Print it back out.  Concatenating a regular string
   -- with the Unbounded_String results in an Unbounded_String,
   -- so we are using the Put_Line in the Ada.Text_IO.Unbounded_IO
   -- package here.
   UIO.Put_Line("You entered: " & MyString);
end Unbounded_Example;
 \end{lstlisting}    
\end{figure}


It is possible to add use clauses for both |Ada.Text_IO| and |Ada.Text_IO.Unbounded_IO| to the
same program; the compiler will determine which is the correct one to use by looking at the
types of the arguments you pass.

If you have one string type but need to pass it to a function or assign it to a variable of the
other type, there are |To_String| and |To_Unbounded_String| helper functions available in
|Ada.String.Unbounded| for doing this. One very common case is assigning a constant string to an
|Unbounded_String|, like so:

\begin{lstlisting}
MyUnboundedString := To_Unbounded_String("Hello there!");
\end{lstlisting}

Another common need is to convert between string types and other basic types such as integer,
floating point, and even enumeration types. Ada has a built-in facility for doing this, but you
do need to be careful because it may throw an exception if the text in the string does not look
like the type of thing you are trying to convert it to.

For all of Ada's basic types (including ones you create), there is a |'Value| attribute that
accepts a string and returns an item of that type. Using it might look like:

\begin{lstlisting}
MyInteger := Integer'Value(MyString);
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Because this only accepts fixed strings, if you have your value in an
|Unbounded_String|, you will need to convert it to a |String| first. This can be done with the
|To_String| function like so:

\begin{lstlisting}
MyFloat := Float'Value(To_String(MyUnboundedString));
\end{lstlisting}

It also may be handy to have a string representation of a variable, and that can be done with
the |'Image| attribute of the type. That might look like:

\begin{lstlisting}
Put_Line("The number is: " & Natural'Image(MyNaturalNumber));
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent In this case, we convert |MyNaturalNumber| to a |String| and then concatenate it to
our message to print it out. This is handy for small programs, but if you do IO with a type
often, you will want to instantiate one of the generic packages that come with the compiler (eg.
|Ada.Text_IO.Integer_IO|, |Ada.Text_IO.Float_IO|, |Ada.Text_IO.Enumeration_IO|, etc.) with your
type. Listing~\ref{lst:io-program} shows an example using a newly declared type.

\begin{figure}[tbhp]
    \begin{lstlisting}[
    frame=single,
    xleftmargin=0in,
    caption={IO Program},
    label=lst:io-program]
with Ada.Text_IO;
procedure IO_Example is
   -- Create my own type.
   type Channel is new Natural range 1 .. 13;

   -- Instantiate a version of Integer_IO for the Channel type.
   package Channel_IO is new Ada.Text_IO.Integer_IO(Channel);

   -- Declare a variable of this type.
   MyChannel : Channel;
begin
   Ada.Text_IO.Put("Enter a channel: ");

   -- Read in a value between 1 and 13 inclusive (or throw an exception)
   Channel_IO.Get(MyChannel);

   -- Print out a message with the value and move to the next line.
   Ada.Text_IO.Put("You entered: ");
   Channel_IO.Put(MyChannel);
   Ada.Text_IO.New_Line;
end IO_Example;
    \end{lstlisting}    
\end{figure}

The advantage to instantiating one of the IO packages for each of your custom types is that the
compiler will guarantee that the input converts to a valid value (i.e., is within a range
specified in the type definition) or will throw a |Data_Error| exception. One minor annoyance is
that there is no |put_line| procedure in these generic packages. This means you will need to use
|New_Line| from |Ada.Text_IO| if you want to print a value and move to the next line, as shown
in Listing~\ref{lst:io-program}.
